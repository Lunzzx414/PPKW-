LumCake — A pastel, aesthetic demo website

Files created:
- index.html — the landing page
- styles.css — pastel aesthetic styles
- script.js — small interactivity (theme toggle, confetti, contact mock)
- assets/ — put the provided `lumcake-logo.png` here and optional menu images `cake1.jpg`, `cake2.jpg`, `cake3.jpg`

How to run locally:
1. Place the provided image (from your attachment) in `assets/lumcake-logo.png`.
2. Optionally add three menu images in `assets/` named `cake1.jpg`, `cake2.jpg`, `cake3.jpg`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).

Notes:
- This is a static demo. For production, replace the contact form with a proper backend endpoint.
- I kept the layout responsive and added a dark-theme toggle.

Next steps you might want:
- Add real images and content.
- Hook the contact form to an API.
- Improve accessibility (aria labels, focus states).
